We can use the data from a physical file just like any database / API source
<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### ðŸ“„ src/components/SearchResults.vue
```vue
15     const filteredTitles = computed(() => {
16         return titles.filter(s => s.Name.toLowerCase().includes(props.query.toLowerCase()));
17     });
```

<br/>

Getting the source data:

<br/>

Use the composable to get the data from a central point. This way we don't care what the actual source of the data is
<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### ðŸ“„ src/components/SearchResults.vue
```vue
12     import useData from "../composables/useData";
13     const data = useData();
```

<br/>

What the data looks like:

<br/>

You can find the data in the public directory
<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### ðŸ“„ public/data.json
```json
2        {
3          "Name": "Setting Up your First Vue3 Project - Vue 3.0 Release",
4          "Page": "https://learnvue.co/2020/09/setting-up-your-first-vue3-project-vue-3-0-release/"
5        },
```

<br/>

Setting up the composable

<br/>

get the data any way you want and expose it for users (usually you would want this to be reactive).
<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### ðŸ“„ src/composables/useData.js
```javascript
1      import titles from '/data.json';
2      
3      export default function useData() {
4          return { titles };
5      }
```
